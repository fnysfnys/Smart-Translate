#Smart Translate

Financial translation software written in Java with translation memory and fuzzy matching. Loads in Microsoft DOCX files, extracts text, allowing the user to translate the document sentence by sentence in a GUI. The translation can then be exported to a DOCX file with formatting matching the original document.
Translated sentences are saved to memory and auto-translated in future, with automated regionalisation of numbers. Created as a lightweight, faster, and free alternative to SDL Trados.
